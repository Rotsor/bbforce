# Boolean Brute Force

This is a brute force solution for the first part of the following [puzzle from MIT Tech Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/sites/default/files/magazine/mitnews/puzzlecorner/MA13MITPuzzleCorner.pdf).

_Howard Cohen has plenty of AND and OR gates but just two inverters. How can he invert three signals a, b, and c?_

_More generally, he wonders if the ratio I/S can ever be less than 2/3, where I is the number of inverters and S is the number of signals to invert (once again, unlimited AND and OR gates are available)._
